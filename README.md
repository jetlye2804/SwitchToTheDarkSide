# SwitchToTheDarkSide
Tutorial test app to show how to implement a switch to change the appearance between light, dark and automatic 

The app is localised and gives the user the option to change systemwide the settings for dark and light mode. These are set to userdefaults fior the next time the app is launched.

It is the full solution. 
I use SwiftUI and localised strings!

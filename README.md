# Switch To The Dark Side in SwiftUI

This repo is intended to serve as a starting point for a blog post on how to implement a switch to change the appearance between light, dark and automatic in SwiftUI AppDelegate based structure.


The app is localised and gives the user the option to change systemwide the settings for dark and light mode. These are set to userdefaults fior the next time the app is launched.

It is the full solution. 
I use SwiftUI and localised strings!
